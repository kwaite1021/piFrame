<br>
<p>A Node web server for Raspberry Pi electronics testing
There are pre-built, ready to go modules which include:
<ul>
  <li> Level out high or low - turn something on / off </li>
  <li> Software PWM - select a pin and PWM duty cycle </li>
  <li> Square wave out - select pin, frequency & duty cycle</li>
  <li> Measure a pulse width</li>
  <li> Trigger pulse output with many options</li>
  <li> SPI interface to the Cypress PSOC Pioneer kit [or use Arduino, etc.]</li>
  <li> A flex container for you to write your own app</li> 
  <li> A tiddlyWiki digital notebook for Raspberry Pi [editable single file html] </li>
</ul>
The modules will work out of the box with the pi 3 and 2.Recommended to use a Raspberry Pi 3 although Pi 2 will also work. 
<h3>Installation</h3>
Please use nvm to install Node & npm onto your pi. This will ensure you have the latest & correct version.
Unzip the piFrame into your Node directory.
Linux - run the 'piframe.sh' as './piframe.sh' from the piFrame directory on your Raspberry Pi. Open your local browser at 'yourPi_IPaddress:3000'. The node server outputs the web page on port 3000 - remember that both the Pi and your local PC, tablet, or phone must be on the same local address, irregardless if you are using WiFi or ethernet.
You may find your Pi's IP address by using your modem/ router config page, or in Linux by running XXXXXXXXXXXX
At this point you should see piFrame running.
